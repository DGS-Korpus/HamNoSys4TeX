# _hamnosys_ - Using HamNoSys in TeX
This is the TeX package _hamnosys_, which makes the HamNoSys font available in TeX documents.
The Hamburg Notation System, HamNoSys for short, is a system for the phonetic transcription of signed languages.

# Requirements
The _hamnosys_ package requires XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX. It has been tested on TeX Live 2021.

# Installation
If your TeX distribution does not contain the package, you can install it manually by copying the files `hamnosys.sty` and `HamNoSysUnicode.ttf` from this repository. To install it locally for a single project, copy the files into the root directory of your TeX project. To install it globally, copy the files into a `hamnosys/` subdirectory in the appropriate location in your TeX installation. To generate the documentation, compile `hamnosys.dtx` using XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX.

To use HamNoSys in other parts of your operating system and for a wider range of input methods, see the [HamNoSys Software Package](https://doi.org/10.25592/uhhfdm.9724).

# Usage
The package provides three methods of entering HamNoSys symbols:
1. Direct input of HamNoSys symbols as Unicode characters. As HamNoSys symbols can only be displayed by the HamNoSys font, you must either
   1. explicitly switch fonts using `\texthamnosys{}` or `\hamnosysfont`, or 
   2. use the `autofont` package option (XeTeX only).
2. Listing HamNoSys symbol names inside the command `\hamnosys{}`.
3. Using the commands that have been defined for each individual HamNoSys symbol.
